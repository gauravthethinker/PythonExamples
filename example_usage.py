    Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

    Deep Learning is a specialized area of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data.

    Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

    Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos.

    Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
